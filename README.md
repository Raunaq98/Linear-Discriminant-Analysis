# Linear Discriminant Analysis

**Logistic regression** is a classification algorithm traditionally limited to only two-class classification problems.
If you have more than two classes then **Linear Discriminant Analysis** is the preferred linear classification technique.

Linear Discriminant Analysis all the problems faced by logistic regression and is the go-to linear method for multi-class classification problems. 
Even with binary-classification problems, it is a good idea to try both logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.

# Assumptions

    1. That your data is Gaussian, that each variable is is shaped like a bell curve when plotted.
    2. That each attribute has the same variance, that values of each variable vary around the mean by the same amount on average.
